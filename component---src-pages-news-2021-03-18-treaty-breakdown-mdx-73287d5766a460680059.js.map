However, the Charter of the\nAugustan Federation lacked certain policies and arrangements, such as\nextradition, and suggested possibly resolving these issues with standalone\ntreaties. Lodish then mentioned that the Commonwealth, known for its lax\nextradition policy, would be interested in such an extradition treaty, and so\nthe Lord Admiral took the opportunity to spearhead what could turn out to be a\nmultinational cooperative.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Since the Admiralty of Wesbury is such a tiny nation almost entirely surrounded\nby much larger and more established nations - that anyone can leave Wesbury's\njurisdiction by walking in any direction for a handful of seconds - attempting\nto enforce Wesbury's laws necessarily requires having frictionless extradition\npolicies with neighbouring states.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"/uploads/wesbury_relative_size.png\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`The fundamental premise of the extradition treaty was that signatories would\nrefrain from claiming jurisdiction over captured persons if the claim of\njurisdiction is based solely on location: that say for the sake of argument that\nsomeone committed a devastating raid on South Augusta and was pursued and\ncaptured within the borders of Wesbury, this treaty would ensure that Wesbury\nwould not interfere or impose itself since the location of the capture was\npurely incidental and irrelevant to the charges arrayed against the suspect.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Given that such a premise only applies in rather narrow circumstances and that\nthe full text of the treaty had yet to be negotiated, discussed, or even\nfinished, it was surprising therefore when Allen, a respected member of the\nSeptembrian community that had no relevant official role in the treaty\nnegotiations nor seemingly any interest to have one, began arguing with and\naccosting the Lord Admiral, disparaging the treaty as fundamentally and\nirreconcilably incompatible with Mount September. Indeed, Allen had already\nexpressed his objections (prior to any discussion of the fundamental premise)\nover to the intention to ratify the treaty as law rather than kept as a mere\npolitical promise, which is apparently incredibly problematic.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"/uploads/alleny_treaty_obstinacy.png\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`While the treaty would allow Wesbury to more reliably enforce its laws, it would\nalso decrease the potential ire from powerful military factions which,\nconsidering the two world wars, could flatten Wesbury without difficulty or\nhesitation with the Lord Admiral potentially disappearing into a vault, so the\ntreaty was in part the ratification of a procedure that's already expected of\nsmaller, less militant states.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Some in Mount September suggested that such a treaty is unnecessary since\naggrieved nations can simply submit an extradition request to the judiciary of\nMount September, that Wesbury was in fact asking for special entitlement to\nrandomly kidnap wholesome newfiends from Mount September and subject them to\nunfair treatment. The Lord Admiral obviously saw it differently, that Mount\nSeptember's laws of extradition left a lot to be desired:`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F-fg1JJw1emH2S1DsMrBWgr4AAUgap0ccQPfkdqKhFo/edit\"\n      }}><img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"src\": \"/uploads/mount_september_extradition_law.png\",\n          \"alt\": null\n        }}></img></a></p>\n    <p>{`The Lord Admiral expressed practical concerns: that in a situation where Wesbury\nis devastated with grief for example and the perpetrator happens to be pearled\nslightly within the borders of Mount September, the last thing the Lord Admiral\nor really anyone would want to do is loiter on the fringes of Mount September's\nborders waiting and hoping for the Supreme Court to assemble and rule on the\nmatter in a timely manner; that he'd prefer to return to Wesbury to repair the\ndamage and respect the ruling when it comes; that there's no practical\ndifference between the two in Mount September's ability to actually enforce the\nrespect of the ruling thus the latter should be allowed out of respect.\nAdditionally, there were concerns about the Supreme Court's ability to rule\narbitrarily: that the law specifies ways in which the court `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`may`}</em>{` allow the\nextradition, but that the court could reject the request for any reason or even\nno reason at all, or subject different nations to entirely different definitions\nof just and fair. And lastly that the court seems to impose its will upon the\npearl even after it leaves the territorial jurisdiction of Mount September: that\naggrieved nations must adequately explain and have a game-plan imposed upon them\nabout how the suspect will be brought to justice which if deviated from for any\nreason must be adequately justified to Mount September or otherwise face the\nconsequences including but not limited to the prohibition of future\nextraditions. And `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`all of this`}</em>{` is because the suspect was, in the example,\nmerely captured a few blocks inside Mount September's borders as defined on the\nccmap. He considers this completely impractical if not outright disrespectful,\nespecially since Mount September's first extradition request seemingly prevented\nthe claimant from the chance to purchase a PS5, so the slow and bureaucratic\ninstitutions have already had tangibly negative effects on real people in their\nreal lives on its first try.`}</p>\n    <p>{`That being said, while that extradition request had tangible real world\nconsequences, it still happened relatively quickly since the request was made\nduring American peak time hours. Whereas it's possible that, should the request\nbe submitted during European, Asian, or Oceanic peak times that the request\ncould potentially take hours, perhaps even close to a day depending on the day\nand activity level, all the while having to linger within Mount September's\nborders.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"/uploads/can_i_haz_pearl.png\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`Any and all attempts at recourse and remedy for this involved submitting\nwholeheartedly to Mount September law in the eyes of Allen, there was no room\nfor compromise or alternative solutions, particularly since Allen contests\nWesbury's legitimacy as a nation state at all since the low population count\nmakes it not adequately democratic in his opinion. The Lord Admiral attempted to\nsatire these absolutist views, suggesting a perma-pearl sentence for crossing\nthe border without a visa, threatening to tear up Mount September's rails that\nhappen to pass through Wesbury's territory, threatening to pearl a Septembrian\nresident for \"infringing on Wesbury's mineral rights\", all the while playing up\nthe ridiculousness by emphasising how arbitrary these decisions are because\nWesbury is apparently just as arbitrary. Unfortunately however, Allen and other\nSeptembrians were oblivious to or otherwise un-phased by this, considering it\nbusiness as usual and just another exercise of sovereignty that's perfectly\nreasonable on civ.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The Lord Admiral realised that any attempt to negotiate this treaty would be in\nvain, particularly since the Septembrian diplomat resigned before treaty\nnegotiations began, as well as there being no indication of the appointment of a\nnew diplomat happening in a timely manner, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`as well as`}</em>{` the indication that a\ndedicated diplomatic channel would not be created until a new diplomat is\nappointed, thus relegating important treaty negotiations to the court of public\nopinion before anything's decided upon. Thus the Admiralty of Wesbury has\nformally withdrawn from treaty negotiations with Mouth September since the Lord\nAdmiral currently considers Mount September as an unreliable neighbour.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
