Instead of negotiating an extradition treaty, he would take\nMount September's extradition process as a given and build around it to make it\nas painless and frictionless as possible.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"/uploads/mount_september_embassy_island.png\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`The image above shows an island almost exactly halfway between Wesbury and\nMount September. At first the Lord Admiral wanted the island to be a\ncondominium or shared island, to be co-owned by Wesbury and Mount September\nwhere both can store pearls from the other while pending approval, however Mount\nSeptember took no interest in this solution and instead favoured expanding their\nsovereign borders to claim the island so that Wesbury could construct a secure\nstorage bunker there like one could a shop or a house.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Since the bunker, or \"embassy\" was to be constructed under the same law as shops\nand houses, the Lord Admiral requested certain opt-outs to property regulations:\ndereliction and build codes, both current and future. The Lord Admiral had\nchosen the island for very specific reasons: it's small, out of the way, and is\nocean biome and so would hopefully not be attractive to anyone wishing to claim\nland through the dereliction process. However, the Lord Admiral still desired\nsome legal certainty, and those exceptions seemed reasonable to those within the\ndiplomacy channel, notably Allen, but then...`}</p>\n    <p>{`Almost two weeks later a new Septembrian diplomat was appointed. The Lord\nAdmiral re-suggested the condominium and shared island solutions as to try and\nensure the treaty as bilateral and mutually beneficial, however this was\npromptly ignored. The diplomat went on to reject the exceptions to property\nregulations that were previously considered reasonable by members of the\nCupboard (Mount September's Cabinet), that all he could offer was the political\npromise of notifying Wesbury should a dereliction request be made against the\nisland; that Mount September's acquiescence to expanding their borders was\nalready a generous offer that should be enough for Wesbury, and that if Wesbury\ndoesn't trust Mount September then why even continue these negotiations?`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"/uploads/mount_september_embassy_opt_out.gif\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`This breakdown angered the Lord Admiral. The first treaty negotiations failed\nbecause Mount September fundamentally did not trust Wesbury. This reattempt at\nnegotiating a favourable outcome was taking Mount September's lack of trust in\nWesbury as a given and basing a solution off of it, and yet the Septembrian\ndiplomatic admonished Wesbury for its reciprocal lack of trust. In addition,\nwhile the Lord Admiral accepted and agreed that the border expansion was highly\nunusual for an embassy negotiation, he nonetheless found the framing of it as an\n\"already generous offer\" and \"`}{`[`}{`not trusting Mount September`}{`]`}{` even when weâ€™ve\ngone to such lengths\" deeply disrespectful and obtuse. This was compounded when\nhe asked why Mount September wasn't discussing a reciprocal and thus mutually\nbeneficial solution should Mount September need to extradite a pearl from\nWesbury, to which the diplomat said he had no interest in making any\narrangements with Wesbury.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Given that the treaty negotiations were forcibly whittled down to be lesser than\neven the Declaration of Friendship treaties, and that the little being \"offered\"\nwas being framed as an exceptional undertaking, the Lord Admiral backed out of\nnegotiations for a second time, figuring that it would be easier to simply build\na secure storage ship within Mount September's territorial waters and hope that\nthe borders aren't changed to exclude the ship. This arrangement would also have\nthe benefit of not giving fuel to the notion that Mount September has given\nWesbury a favour with its \"generous offer,\" thus making Wesbury politically\nbeholden to Mount September.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
