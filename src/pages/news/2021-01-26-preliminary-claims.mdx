The Lord Admiral of Wesbury has [officially declared](https://old.reddit.com/r/civclassics/comments/l57fnd/claims_of_the_admiralty_of_wesbury/)
the preliminary claims of Wesbury to the international community. They are
preliminary as while there are definitive claims - the plains, beach, and river
biomes of former Brodre - there is a larger, encompassing claim of a reasonable
but uncertain size consisting of some area of snow biome. The Lord Admiral will
clarify the borders in due course.
