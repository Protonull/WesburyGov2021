excerpt: Follow-up negotiations breakdown
---
Shortly after the first treaty negotiations broke down, the Lord Admiral tried
something different. Instead of negotiating an extradition treaty, he would take
Mount September's extradition process as a given and build around it to make it
as painless and frictionless as possible.

The image above shows an island almost exactly halfway between Wesbury and
Mount September. At first the Lord Admiral wanted the island to be a
condominium or shared island, to be co-owned by Wesbury and Mount September
where both can store pearls from the other while pending approval, however Mount
September took no interest in this solution and instead favoured expanding their
sovereign borders to claim the island so that Wesbury could construct a secure
storage bunker there like one could a shop or a house.

Since the bunker, or "embassy" was to be constructed under the same law as shops
and houses, the Lord Admiral requested certain opt-outs to property regulations:
dereliction and build codes, both current and future. The Lord Admiral had
chosen the island for very specific reasons: it's small, out of the way, and is
ocean biome and so would hopefully not be attractive to anyone wishing to claim
land through the dereliction process. However, the Lord Admiral still desired
some legal certainty, and those exceptions seemed reasonable to those within the
diplomacy channel, notably Allen, but then...

Almost two weeks later a new Septembrian diplomat was appointed. The Lord
Admiral re-suggested the condominium and shared island solutions as to try and
ensure the treaty as bilateral and mutually beneficial, however this was
promptly ignored. The diplomat went on to reject the exceptions to property
regulations that were previously considered reasonable by members of the
Cupboard (Mount September's Cabinet), that all he could offer was the political
promise of notifying Wesbury should a dereliction request be made against the
island; that Mount September's acquiescence to expanding their borders was
already a generous offer that should be enough for Wesbury, and that if Wesbury
doesn't trust Mount September then why even continue these negotiations?

This breakdown angered the Lord Admiral. The first treaty negotiations failed
because Mount September fundamentally did not trust Wesbury. This reattempt at
negotiating a favourable outcome was taking Mount September's lack of trust in
Wesbury as a given and basing a solution off of it, and yet the Septembrian
diplomatic admonished Wesbury for its reciprocal lack of trust. In addition,
while the Lord Admiral accepted and agreed that the border expansion was highly
unusual for an embassy negotiation, he nonetheless found the framing of it as an
"already generous offer" and "\[not trusting Mount September\] even when weâ€™ve
gone to such lengths" deeply disrespectful and obtuse. This was compounded when
he asked why Mount September wasn't discussing a reciprocal and thus mutually
beneficial solution should Mount September need to extradite a pearl from
Wesbury, to which the diplomat said he had no interest in making any
arrangements with Wesbury.

Given that the treaty negotiations were forcibly whittled down to be lesser than
even the Declaration of Friendship treaties, and that the little being "offered"
was being framed as an exceptional undertaking, the Lord Admiral backed out of
negotiations for a second time, figuring that it would be easier to simply build
a secure storage ship within Mount September's territorial waters and hope that
the borders aren't changed to exclude the ship. This arrangement would also have
the benefit of not giving fuel to the notion that Mount September has given
Wesbury a favour with its "generous offer," thus making Wesbury politically
beholden to Mount September.
