The Lord Admiral has issued a series of laws pursuant to Article 2 of the
Declaration of Occupation: [**Formatting of Dates**](/Wesbury/laws/date-formats), a new
law to format dates in particular ways in official contexts to increase
comprehension given the difference of ordering between different cultures;
[**Border Definitions**](/Wesbury/laws/border-definitions), a re-ratification of
Wesbury's borders pursuant to Article 2, Article 3, and Article 8 of the
Declaration of Occupation; and lastly, [**National Anthem**](/Wesbury/laws/national-anthem)
and [**Grandfathering Pre-Existing Infrastructure**](/Wesbury/laws/pre-existing-infrastructure)
have simply been re-ratified as issued laws.
