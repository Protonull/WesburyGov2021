The Lord Admiral has issued a law imposing restrictions on certain goods and
services. Player Essence has been classified as a Class A good, meaning that it
may only be sold to the state, and the state may only sell it to entities
approved under law. Additionally, Gunpowder has been classified as a Class C
good, requiring sellers to have reasonably strong protection of their shop.
