Wesbury now has its own Civball: Wesball, which is now being used as the Discord
server icon. It also tacitly confirms the national colours as orange and blue,
the orange being a colour that has followed the Lord Admiral from the Republic
of Ashelor representing vitality and beauty; and the blue represents liberty and
new opportunities; together they represent the majesty of the sunset upon the
high seas.
